 THIS IS THE BASIC COMMAND LINE THAT EVERY DEVELOPER WILL ATLEAST KNOW AND I KNOW THEM TO


 1.cd =>Changing the Directory
 2.cd .\Users\Documents => this helps us to append on the existing directory
 3.cd .~\docu when you use this tilda and hit tab then you don't need to type out everything manually
 4.cd.. => this helps to move out one path on the same directory 
 	cd ..\Desktop => this will help to jumps directy to another path 
 	cd ~\Desktop => this will jump you directly to anothe directory 
 5.mkdir => this command helps to create folder within the commandline
 6.touch => this command helps to create a file within commandLine and it is fast
 7.rm => this helps to delete any file or folder 
 8.rm \.file.txt  => so this is way of deleting a file in some directory 
 9.rm \.file.txt -force => so this command is used if you are deleting files and 
 they tell you that you are not allowed to delete it and hence you want to delete it so you have to append on it --force
 it will be delete imediately

 10 .cp=> this type of compand it helps us to copy one file from one place to another
 	cp 'pl.txt' C:\Users\placide\Documents\
 	cp 'folder' C:\Users\placide\Documents\ = > if there is other files that are in it will not include them unless you add
 	other command which id -Recurse -Versbose so the verbose will show us each line that has been copied and even show us 
 	the error that might occur
 	cp 'folder' C:\Users\placide\Documents\ -recurse -verbose


 11. mv => so this command helps to move or rename the file if they are in the same location and also 
 move it from one location to this other location
 	mv .\plac.txt placide.txt
 	mv .\plac.txt C:\Users\placide\Documents\

 12. ls => so this command is used to list all the item that should be in reside in the given file

	PS C:\Users\placide\Documents> ls C:\Users\placide\Documents\pals\ => this means we can also be able to list other files without changing our path

	PS C:\Users\placide\Documents> ls .\pals => this works pretty the same as above
	ls -force C:\ => this will show all the hidden files that are in the C:drive

13.pwd => this command will print out the current working directory 
14.whoami => this will show you the user that you are using 
15.echo => so this command also helps to output whatever text that you want to display in the console
	echo 'woof'
	echo woof> dog.txt => this will insert this word woof into dog.txt
	echo doggy>> dog.txt => this will append to what is existing in dog.txt
16.cat => so this command it is used to read some text files inside the command line 
	cat plc.txt
	cat Person.java
	cat Person.java -head 10 => this will give us the first 10 lines of the text instead of showing us everything in the file
	cat Person.java -Tail 10=> this will give us the last 10 lines of the file
17.less => this also helps to read somefiles which are are large from the console where you
can use space to jump up a paragraph and enter key advande one line so you can use it if you want to move slowly to 
	the file 

		so once you are in you will need to go out and using ctrl C will not help you to move out 
		unless you use q key  so that how you can quit
18.select-string cow plc.txt ==> so this command will helps us to find if a word cow is in plc.txt

19. PS C:\Users\placide\Documents> ls C:\Users\placide\Documents\ -recurse -filter *.java => this will helps us to look for files that have .java extension in the documents folder so the -filter parameter will filter out all the matching files
so adding the recurse will retrieve all the files includes those which are in the folders

20. pipe line sending one command as  the input of another command;
	PS C:\Users\placide\Documents> cat Person.java | Select-String name
	so here we want to search from Person.java a word which is name.

	it is also possible to take what you have outputted and puts into another files by using the redirection
	PS C:\Users\placide\Documents> cat Person.java | Select-String name > placha.txt


21. taking out errors in the files instead of putting it into the console
	PS C:\Users\placide\Documents> ls Person.java 2>error.txt we can do just like this so this number 2 means it is for standard error



	so this is are the very basic commands that as a developer that we shoud know so that to get alot done.
