												Equals and HashCode methods
												---------------------------
	By using this equal methods and Hashcode most of the time they are used in comparison of Objects not numerics
	so talking about equals method it has  its contract 


												Equals Contract
												==============

		1.Reflexivity: here an object must be equal to itself.
		2.Symmetry: This means two object must agree if they are equal of not.
		3.Transivity:if one object is equal to a second,and the second to a third, the first must be equal to the third
		4.Consistency:if two objects  are equal  they must remain equal for all time ,unless one of them is changed
		5.Null returns false: all objects must be unequal to null



													HashCode
													==========
	For Processing similar object are putted into a collection,such collection in java it is like a powerfull array,
	besides other things it allows you to look up other objects ,not only based on their index position but also based
	on their specific values.

											HashCode Contract
											------------------

	1.For any two  objects  return same hashCodes  when equals returns true
	2.When a hashcode is Invoked  more then once on the  same object, it must consistently return  the same int  values as long as the  object  is not changed

	3.YOU SHOULD OVERWRITE HASHCODE  WHENEVER  YOU OVERWRITE EQUALS
	4.Aim to return  different hashCodes when equals  returns  false.

	this one is complicated I will learning it after when I get good in Progaramming.
